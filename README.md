# DEVOPS-16
## What is in this template repo

Here we have a cli node app called `pipeline`. The commands are defined in `./commands` directory, and configuration management (Ansible) scripts are to be added in `./pipeline`.

In `./pipeline` we included a template for the files you will need (`playbook.yml`, and `inventory.ini`), as well as an example for Ansible roles (`./cm/roles/ping`).
