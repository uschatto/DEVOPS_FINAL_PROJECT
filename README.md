## PROGRESS REPORT
> <p align="justify">We were able to complete the first major task to automatically configure a jenkins server. The command "pipeline setup" when run, successfully will bring up two VMs namely ansible-srv and jenkins-srv. After which the Ansible playbook runs and configures the jenkins-srv. We were able to turn off the jenkins setup wizard and handle authentication automatically. We have started working on the second major task to automatically configure a build environment for checkbox.io to run.</p>
